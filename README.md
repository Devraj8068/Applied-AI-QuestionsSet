# MCQ Quiz — Command Line

A small command-line multiple-choice quiz program (Python).  
It reads questions from `quiz.json`, asks each question one-by-one, validates user input (only 1/2/3/4 allowed), stores the user's answers, and **after all questions have been answered** prints a results summary showing:

- The question
- The user's selection (text)
- The correct answer (text)
- Whether the user was correct or wrong
- Final score (X / total)

To run:
Clone → cd → run python quiz.py.
